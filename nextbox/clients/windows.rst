Connect using WebDAV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Warning::

   There have been reports that the native WebDAV support in Windows is not performing well. We 
   recommend using the Nextcloud App (as described above) for the best user experience. Additionally
   please read `Nextcloud's Windows WebDAV Known Problems`_.

1. Add a WebDAV drive using the file explorer's "Add a network location" icon. (You can also use 
   "Map network drive" to bind your Nextcloud to a drive, like *Z:*).

2. In the following dialog please enter the full WebDAV address of your
   NextBox: ``https://my.domain.tld/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME``. Replace *my.domain.tld* with
   your NextBox's public domain and *USERNAME* with the username you would like to connect.

3. In the following window insert your full Nextcloud credentials, means your username and password
   you use to login into your Nextcloud.
